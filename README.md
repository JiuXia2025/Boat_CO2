 # how to use?
 Its usage is the same as the BoatApp project, you can also install it as follows
 ## Step 1: Install the game package and running environment
 ### 1. Install the game package
 Unzip the game package containing the Minecraft game version to the /sdcard/boat/ folder (these game packages can be compressed after downloading the version in other game launchers, and can also be found on the Internet)
 ### 2. Install the runtime library
 Copy the app_runtime folder to the /data/data/cosine.boat/ folder.  They include operating environments such as busybox, openjdk, etc. (These files can also be found on the Internet, this project does not contain these content, you must install it yourself)
 ## Step 2: Modify the configuration file
 Use an editor to open /sdcard/boat/config.txt, modify the java running memory, game id, uuid, token, etc.
 ## Step 3: Start the game
 When you have prepared the running environment and game files, you can enter the program and click the "Play" button to play the game.  It may take a while to load the game. If you encounter a crash, please try to modify the running memory to check whether the file is complete
